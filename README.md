# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Implementations
This repository contains various implementations of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm in Python and JavaScript. LCS is a classic problem in computer science and dynamic programming. It's used to determine the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

## Description
The LCS problem involves finding the longest subsequence present in a given set of sequences where the subsequence is not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

## Implementations
Python Implementations
LCS_Top_down: Implements the LCS algorithm using a top-down dynamic programming approach.
LCS_by_Memoization: Solves the LCS problem using recursion with memoization to improve efficiency.
LCS_by_recursion: A basic recursive implementation of the LCS algorithm.
JavaScript Implementation
LcsByTopDown: A JavaScript implementation of the LCS algorithm using a top-down approach.
Usage
Each file contains a main function or equivalent for testing purposes. You can run these scripts to see the LCS algorithm in action.

For Python scripts, use python filename.py.
For JavaScript, run node filename.js.
Ensure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system to run these scripts.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the algorithms or add new ones are welcome. Please follow the standard GitHub pull request process to submit your changes.
